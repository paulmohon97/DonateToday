                        other
                        charitable causes. We might
                        part with our cash in response to some requests, but choose to ignore others. Have you ever
                        wondered
                        what triggers these differential responses? Why does someone who wells up with empathy for one
                        victim
                        turn the other way when witnessing the plight of others?</p>

                    Donating to the causes you care about not only benefits the charities themselves, it can be deeply
                    rewarding for you too. Millions of people give to charity on a regular basis to support causes they
                    believe in, as well as for the positive effect it has on their own lives.

                believe in, you can also potentially qualify for tax deductions. Learn more about the major types of
                planned giving and benefits you can pursue, as well as how to avoid charity-related scams, with our
